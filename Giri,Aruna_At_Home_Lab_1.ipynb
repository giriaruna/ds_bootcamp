1. Write a function  count_vowels(word) that takes a word as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the word
2. Iterate through the following list of animals and print each one in all caps.


  animals=['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther']


3. Write a program that iterates from 1 to 20, printing each number and whether it's odd or even.
4. Write a function sum_of_integers(a, b) that takes two integers as input from the user and returns their sum.
